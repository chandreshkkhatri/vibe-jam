# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Simple Blogging Platform Backend

## Overview

This document outlines the backend requirements for a simple blogging platform. The platform will allow users to register, authenticate, create and manage blog entries, and interact with posts through likes and comments.

## Goals

- Enable user registration and authentication
- Allow users to create, edit, and delete their own blog entries
- Support likes and comments on blog entries

## Requirements

### 1. User Authentication System

- Users can register with email and password
- Users can log in and log out
- Passwords must be securely hashed
- Authenticated sessions (JWT or session-based)
- Only authenticated users can create, edit, or delete their own blog entries

### 2. Blog Entry Management

- Authenticated users can create new blog entries
- Users can edit or delete only their own blog entries
- Blog entries have a title, content, author, timestamps (created/updated)
- List all blog entries (publicly visible)
- View a single blog entry with its details

### 3. Likes

- Authenticated users can like or unlike any blog entry
- Each user can like a blog entry only once
- Display the number of likes per blog entry

### 4. Comments

- Authenticated users can comment on any blog entry
- Comments have content, author, timestamps
- Users can delete their own comments
- Display all comments for a blog entry

## Non-Goals

- No support for media uploads (images, videos)
- No rich text editing
- No user roles beyond basic authentication

## Out of Scope

- Frontend implementation
- Admin/moderator features
- Advanced analytics

## Success Metrics

- Users can register, log in, and manage their own blog entries
- Users can like and comment on blog entries
- All actions are secure and respect user permissions

## Future Considerations

- Media uploads
- User profiles
- Tagging and categories
- Search functionality
- Admin/moderator roles
