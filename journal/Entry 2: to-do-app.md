#### Vibe Coding Journal – Day 2

Today, I decided to build a **to-do list app**, but this time I want to take a more **structured approach**. Instead of jumping straight into implementation, I plan to:

- First **conceptualize the app**
- Create a **PRD (Product Requirements Document)**
- Put together a **design document** that covers:
  - Database design
  - API design
  - UI/UX sketches (as needed)

Only after this foundation is laid will I move on to actual development.

I gave **Claude 4** another try today, this time adding **negative prompts** to keep it from going off on tangents. While it worked initially, it eventually forgot to stop—again—and just kept building without pause. I found myself hesitant to interrupt it mid-stream, fearing it might leave things in a broken state.

Switching back to **GPT-4.1** was a relief. It’s more deliberate—it **asks questions before making major decisions**, and offers suggestions rather than bulldozing through the implementation. That balance between initiative and restraint is exactly what I need for structured development.

Since today involved both frontend and backend work, I decided to **split them into separate implementation phases**. I focused entirely on the **backend first**, and only once that’s complete will I shift to building the frontend.

This feels like a good workflow, especially in **mono-repo setups** where you're coordinating multiple parts of the stack. It’s also particularly helpful when working with AI agents—you reduce confusion and keep progress focused.

Excited to see how this more structured approach impacts both quality and maintainability going forward.
